# PostWire

Publish one idea to many social networks, with a **different post written for each one**.

Accounts are connected once through OAuth in the PostWire dashboard, so there is no per-platform
developer app, review queue, or token refresh to maintain. One API key covers every network.

## When to Use This Skill

- The user wants the same idea published to several networks, but written properly for each
- The user wants a post scheduled for later, or a week of posts queued from one topic
- The user asks why a post failed, or whether a post *will* fail before sending it
- The user is publishing video to TikTok or YouTube from an automation

## Overview

PostWire turns one idea into a separate, native post per network and publishes it through a
single call. Accounts are connected once by OAuth in the PostWire dashboard, so there is no
per-platform developer app, review queue or token refresh to maintain.

## What Makes This Different

Most multi-posting APIs take one string and send it to every platform. That reads badly and gets
suppressed: a LinkedIn post written like a tweet performs like neither. PostWire has a `/api/generate`
step that writes a caption per network — length, tone, hashtags and link handling — from a single
prompt, which you then pass to publish or schedule.

It also **refuses posts that are going to fail**, before they are queued rather than after the
platform rejects them:

| network | requires |
|---|---|
| TikTok, YouTube | a video (`video_url`) |
| Instagram | a photo or a video |
| everything else | text is enough |

## Prerequisites

- An account at [postwire.io](https://postwire.io) — free tier: 1 brand, 30 posts/month, no card
- Networks connected in the dashboard (one OAuth click each)
- `POSTWIRE_API_KEY` in the environment

**Auth is `Authorization: Bearer $POSTWIRE_API_KEY`.**

One gotcha worth knowing: the dashboard shows a *preview* key immediately after signup, before the
email is confirmed. That key cannot publish. If the API answers `"This is a preview key"`
(`code: "preview_key"`), confirm the email and take the key from **API & MCP** in the dashboard.

## How to Use

Base URL: `https://postwire.io/api`

### Check what is connected

```bash
curl https://postwire.io/api/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTWIRE_API_KEY"
```

Returns the plan, the monthly usage, and `connections[]` — publish only to networks listed there,
otherwise the call fails with `code: "not_connected"` and the offending platforms.

### Write a native caption per network

```bash
curl -X POST https://postwire.io/api/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTWIRE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "We shipped streaming uploads: 1GB videos now go through in 11 seconds",
    "platforms": ["linkedin", "x", "bluesky"]
  }'
```

Returns `{ "drafts": { "linkedin": {...}, "x": {...}, "bluesky": {...} } }`. That object is what
`per_platform` takes below — but show it to the user first, for the reason in the next section.

## Confirm Before Publishing

`/api/post` and `/api/schedule` are **visible writes**: they put text under the user's own name, in
public, where other people see it. Treat them the way you would treat sending an email as them.

Before either call, show the user:

- the **exact text** that will go out, per network — not the prompt that generated it
- **which networks** it is going to
- **when** it publishes (now, or the exact `run_at`)

and wait for a yes.

This matters most right after `/api/generate`. Those drafts are model output: passing them straight
into `per_platform` without showing them means the user finds out what they said by reading their own
timeline. Generate, show, confirm, then post.

### Publish now

```bash
curl -X POST https://postwire.io/api/post \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTWIRE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platforms": ["linkedin", "x"],
    "per_platform": { "linkedin": {"text": "..."}, "x": {"text": "..."} }
  }'
```

Without `per_platform`, a single `text` is used everywhere — simpler, but it is the behaviour this
tool exists to avoid.

The response is **per platform**, and one failure does not cancel the rest:

```json
{ "results": [ { "ok": true, "platform": "linkedin", "id": "..." },
               { "ok": false, "platform": "x", "error": "..." } ] }
```

### Schedule instead

```bash
curl -X POST https://postwire.io/api/schedule \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTWIRE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "run_at": "2026-09-01T09:00:00Z",
    "platforms": ["linkedin", "instagram"],
    "photo_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    "label": "Launch announcement"
  }'
```

`run_at` is ISO 8601. The schedule endpoint validates connections *and* the media rules up front, so
a post that cannot work is rejected now instead of failing quietly at 7am.

### Fill a week from one topic

```bash
curl -X POST https://postwire.io/api/week \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTWIRE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "topic": "what we learned running a one-person SaaS", "platforms": ["linkedin", "x"], "days": 5 }'
```

Five angles on one topic, queued across five days. Text-only networks only — the video platforms
would reject every one of them, and the endpoint says so rather than queueing them to fail.

## Error Handling

| code | meaning | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `preview_key` | key from before email confirmation | confirm email, use the key in API & MCP |
| `email_unverified` | mailbox not confirmed yet | open the emailed link |
| `not_connected` | platform not connected; `platforms[]` lists which | connect it in the dashboard |
| `media_required` | TikTok/YouTube without video, Instagram without media | add `video_url` or `photo_url` |
| 429 | monthly plan limit or a burst guard | check `usage` in `/api/me` |

## Media Notes

- Media is passed by URL (`video_url`, `photo_url`); PostWire fetches and forwards the bytes.
- TikTok and YouTube videos are streamed in chunks, so they can be up to **1GB**. Other networks and
  hosts that do not send `Content-Length` are capped at 80MB, because the file has to be held in memory.
- `POST /api/media/upload-url` returns a signed URL to upload a file directly (max 50MB) if you do
  not have somewhere to host it.

## Also Available

PostWire ships an **MCP server**, so an agent can call these as tools rather than as HTTP requests,
and there are n8n templates for the same flows. Both are linked from the dashboard.

## Output

`generate_posts` returns `{ drafts: { <platform>: { text, title?, tags? } } }` — one draft per
requested network, each already within that platform's limits.

`post_to_social` returns `{ results: [...] }`, one entry per platform, each either
`{ ok: true, platform, id, url }` or `{ ok: false, platform, error, code }`. The call is
**all-or-nothing on validation**: if any named platform would fail a pre-flight check (not
connected, caption too long, video network with no video) the whole request is refused before
anything publishes, so a four-network post never leaves two live and two silently missing.

`my_account` returns the plan, the month's usage against its limit, and the connected accounts.

## Examples

**Publish one idea, written per network**

```
1. generate_posts { prompt: "we shipped scheduling today", platforms: ["x","linkedin","bluesky"] }
2. show the three drafts to the user and get confirmation
3. post_to_social { platforms: ["x","linkedin","bluesky"], per_platform: <drafts from step 1> }
```

**Publish a video to TikTok and YouTube**

```
post_to_social {
  platforms: ["tiktok","youtube"],
  video_url: "https://example.com/clip.mp4",
  per_platform: { youtube: { title: "...", text: "...", tags: [...] }, tiktok: { text: "..." } },
  privacy: "public"
}
```

**Check what is supported before signing up** — `list_platforms` needs no API key, so an agent can
answer "can you post to Mastodon?" before the user has an account.

# Local-to-staging review: evidence and failure boundaries

## Review details

Server dry-run validates admission, not image pulls, available capacity or model quality. Record those as separate checks.

A cluster connection error must stop the loop. Never silently fall back to the default kubeconfig or a different context.

## Source contract

Sources checked 2026-11-05. Read the current API/tool contract before adapting examples; tenant access and rollout state were not tested against a live CoreWeave account.

## Receipt fields

Record context/namespace identifiers only in the approved private incident system, UTC collection time, selected resource names, command exit status, missing permissions, and any review decision. Separate observed state, inferred cause and proposed change. A denied or incomplete check remains unknown, never a clean bill of health.

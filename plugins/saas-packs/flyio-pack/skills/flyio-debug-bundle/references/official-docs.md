# First-party Fly.io evidence

Consulted on 2026-09-13 for `flyio-debug-bundle`.

## Authority boundary

Fly.io documentation and the provider-maintained flyctl repository define platform behavior. This skill treats local examples as implementation guidance, not as an official SDK, support promise, price lock, regional-capacity guarantee, or proof that a live operation succeeded.

## Sources used

## Product facts applied

- Machine and Machine-version state should both be captured during replacements.
- Health status and its last-change timestamp need interpretation; the timestamp is not the latest check execution.
- Logs and configuration can contain customer or secret-adjacent data and must be bounded and redacted.

## Maintenance rule

Re-fetch the linked first-party pages and current flyctl release before changing authentication, commands, API paths, state names, limits, deployment strategies, storage behavior, or pricing-sensitive guidance. Record the retrieval date and new fingerprints; do not silently preserve stale claims.

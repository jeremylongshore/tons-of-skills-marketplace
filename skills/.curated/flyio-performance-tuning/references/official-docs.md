# First-party Fly.io evidence

Consulted on 2026-09-13 for `flyio-performance-tuning`.

## Authority boundary

Fly.io documentation and the provider-maintained flyctl repository define platform behavior. This skill treats local examples as implementation guidance, not as an official SDK, support promise, price lock, regional-capacity guarantee, or proof that a live operation succeeded.

## Product facts applied

- Fly Proxy uses service concurrency soft limits when deciding excess capacity and starts.
- Autostart starts existing stopped or suspended Machines; it does not create new Machines.
- Machine and volume placement are regional, so application and data topology affect latency.

## Maintenance rule

Re-fetch the linked first-party pages and current flyctl release before changing authentication, commands, API paths, state names, limits, deployment strategies, storage behavior, or pricing-sensitive guidance. Record the retrieval date and new fingerprints; do not silently preserve stale claims.
